# Server-Side Technologies

This repository is a practice projects for learning **Server-Side Technologies** as part of the [ITI course]. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate various server-side techniques and technologies used in web development, such as backend programming, APIs, databases, and deployment.

---

## Course Overview
The **Server-Side Technologies** course focuses on understanding and applying server-side programming to build robust, scalable, and secure web applications. During this course, several practical exercises and mini-projects were completed to reinforce the knowledge gained in lectures.

---

## Project Overview
This project contains multiple mini-projects and exercises that explore the following:

- **Backend Programming**: Building server-side logic using languages like **Node.js** and **PHP**.
- **Web Servers**: Configuring and managing **Apache** for serving web applications.
- **Databases**: Connecting to and managing **MySQL** databases for data storage and retrieval.
- **APIs**: Creating RESTful APIs and integrating them with frontend applications.
- **Containerization**: Using **Docker** to containerize applications for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Deployment**: Deploying server-side applications to cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: For building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- **PHP**: A server-side scripting language for web development.
- **Apache**: A widely-used web server for hosting and serving web applications.
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system for structured data storage.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js to simplify API development.
- **Docker**: For containerization and deployment of applications.
- **RESTful APIs**: Designing and implementing APIs for communication between client and server.
- **Git**: For version control to track changes and collaborate on the project.
